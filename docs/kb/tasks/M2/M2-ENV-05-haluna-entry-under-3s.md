## Goal
The slice perf sweep (docs/kb/qa/gpu/2026-10-24-slice-perf-sweep.md, RX 9070 XT, 1440p) measured Haluna's entry,
from the change request to the scene being in, under the opaque fade:
- **The whole entry:** 3.1 s at High, 3.5 s at Low and 3.1 s at Ultra, against ADR 0029's 3 s zone-entry limit
  (SPEC v1.3 §4.2). The worst single frame, 0.5 s, is fine.
- **SceneRouter's `last_swap_stats`:** `instantiate_ms` is 1570–2050 on the worker thread, and HalunaZone's
  prebuild runs inside it. `prewarm_ms` is 470–490, on top of the threaded load.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Haluna's entry is under 3 s on Low, High and Ultra (measure with
      `tools/gpu_bench/slice_sweep.tscn -- --segments=haluna_beach`).
      Candidates: cache or bake what the prebuild computes at runtime, or split it so part runs after the fade lifts
      without visible frames over 50 ms.
- [ ] No visible frame over 50 ms afterwards (the same tool's `visible_max_ms`).

## Review log

## Lead routing (2026-10-24)
Routed to the **m2-slice** track, which owns Haluna (game/levels/ch02/haluna/**). M1-ARC-16's router now reports `max_visible_frame_ms`, the hidden frames and the entry time, in `SceneRouter.last_swap_stats`; use them to verify. Don't use threaded loads: they crashed Haluna (ADR 0029).

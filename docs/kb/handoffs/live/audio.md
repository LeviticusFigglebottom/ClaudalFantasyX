# Live log: audio (branch `claude/audio`)

Environment: cloud session `session_01FtDSYm5dJHkdC3RqXsDjif`, branch `claude/audio` (from the integration branch
`claude/undertow-lead-handoff-423ixt` at 1023a25). Role: Audio. The Lead reads this file; newest state first.

## MERGE-READY @ c99e6f2b
`tools/ci_local.sh` exit 0 (HYMN_SKIP_BLENDER=1: no Blender source touched): 1499 Godot tests, 0 failed; 75/75 shots
(rmse 0); coverage battle 99.95 % / progression 96.52 % (within baseline); boot smoke clean. Integration branch merged
at f95b27cb. Items: M2-AUD-01..06 and M2-AUD-10/11, M3-AUD-01..07 (all `status: review`). Since c99e6f2b only docs.

## State (2026-10-24, later)
- **Merged into claude/audio since the last MERGE-READY:** M3-AUD-08 Hullgnaw + Spar-Wraith, M3-AUD-09 Cinder Matron +
  Undertow's Reach (stems), M2-AUD-13 causeway beds, M3-AUD-10 Oruvel + the living funeral (all `review`), and the
  integration branch at f8b0db07.
- **Fix:** every loop now imports with `beat_count=0`. Godot 4.6 loops an Ogg after `beat_count` beats counted from
  the file start, so cues with an intro (both battle themes, the sea bosses) wrapped early by their intro and skipped
  the end of their loop. The audio budget is 48 MiB (mix.md "Budget"; ~35 MiB used once these land: a repo-size
  question, Git LFS).
- **In progress:** M3-AUD-11 ferry + shoals routes and M3-AUD-12 Tamsule + the Iskarra vigil (worktree agents).
  **Two items remain.** The full Godot suite and the loudness test are running in the background for the batch line.
- **Filed for m2-slice:** M2-AUD-12 (causeway zone rows, the B05 crossfade, the B12 coda).

## Exact next step
Write the batch MERGE-READY line when the background suite passes; merge M3-AUD-11/12 as they report.

## Un-pushed state
None.
